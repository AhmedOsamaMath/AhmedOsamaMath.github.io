# Cover Letter

Here is why I think I am a right fit:

## SRE Methadologies

* Negotiating and identifying quantitative SLA’s and there respective SLI’s. Communicating resultant SLO’s to all stakeholders.
* Creating incident management framework with clearly defined methodologies to:
    1. Calculate blast radius. (Impacted audience, financial and technical cost).
    2. Escalation Ladder. (ITIL based severity levels to determine course of action)
    3. Establishing incident command, war room, communication and ops team.
    4. Aggregating all related metrics for RCA (Root cause analysis).
    5. Blameless postmortems with written record of an incident, its impact, the actions taken to mitigate or resolve it, the root cause(s), and the follow-up actions to prevent the incident from recurring.

* On-call response to help triage, diagnose, test and cure problems.
* Reducing toil by identifying manual, repetitive and non enduring task and automate them via scripting, tooling or offloading with self sufficient manuals.
* Documentation: Authored Manuals, Rollout Docs, and Proposals for various services and features.
* Establishing best practices by evaluating use-cases published by bigtech, socializing with community, and up to date with newsletter at Infoq, CNCF, Usenix etc

## Practical Infrastructure and Devops

* Championed environments and regions, in GKE (Kubernetes) on GCP. Helm, terraform, Kustomize.
* Controlled and Planned the networks on a distributed cloud-native system. Using GCP firewalls, routing rules, load balancers, nodes.
* Planned and executed required CI/CD pipelines that include every step from contributing, testing, building, deploying, troubleshooting and rollingback. Using tools such as (git,jenkins,harness,spinnaker) etc
* Implemented service mesh to introduce, (Resilience, Security, Dynamic Routing, Tracing and Observabilty)
* For a wix like service (webveloper.com), implemented cloud DNS provisioning with FQDN configurations and TLS.
* Strong trouble shooting skills. For Example
    1. Fine tuned fluentd in production to increase connection resilience and througput.
    2. Fixed a bug in buzzfeed SSO, that prohibited an API and webapp working in same app.
    3. Log and telemetry analysis of envoy based nodes in mesh.
    4. Finding and fixing golang casting bug that stopped pipelines in spinnaker.

* Designed and implemented a highly scalable monitoring and alerting infrastructure that can scale to k8s clusters. Using (Prometheus, grafana, pagerduty, slack)
* Performed on call rotations and incident mitigations. As part of post-mortems, composed suggestions and lessons for future. For Example (Desinged and Created a kubernetes backup utility, reducing disaster recovery timeline to two minutes)
* IAC for creating, managing immutable infrastructure with regional and enviornmental configuration management automated in lifecycle.
* Worked with but not limited to javascript,golang,bash.
* Understanding of working and programming linux based OS.
